Free Camps Help Level Playing Field for Future US Soccer Stars

The happy shouts of children participating in a summer soccer camp emanate from the Tubman Elementary School playing field in Washington D.C.

Pay-to-play soccer structures can make it challenging for kids from low-income families to play competitive, organized soccer in the United States. DC Scores, a nonprofit organization, tries to help level the playing field by offering free high-quality soccer camps like this one to disadvantaged children.

“DC Scores has given me lots of chances in life,” says Christopher, 10, who has been with DC Scores for three years.

DC Scores provides various opportunities to children from low-income families, serving close to 3,000 kids annually. Its programs can be found in more than 42 designated Title I schools in the Washington area. Schools receive Title I classification when they serve a large number of children from low-income families.

Students between the third and eighth grades can join DC Scores’ after-school programs at their respective elementary and middle schools. In fall and spring, participants practice soccer twice a week and have a game at the end of the school week.
