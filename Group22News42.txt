There’s a growing trend across industries when it comes to hiring. And in the age of information, you may be surprised to learn that it involves having access to less information instead of more, in an effort to enhance ethical hiring practices and improve workplace diversity.

If your company isn’t utilizing blind hiring practices yet, it might not be long before it jumps on this progressive new hiring bandwagon.

What is blind hiring?

This bold new hiring practice is referred to as “blind hiring,” and according to a recent article by Analytics in HR (AIHR), “Blind hiring is any technique that anonymizes or ‘blinds’ personal information about a candidate from the recruiter or hiring manager that can lead to unconscious (or conscious) bias about the candidate. This bias tends to be unfair and discriminatory because much of the personal information that is presented is generally unrelated to his or her on-the-job performance.”
