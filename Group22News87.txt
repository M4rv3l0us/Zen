The reason for the dramatic decline is still a mystery to the scientists.

Weimerskirch speculated that it could have been affected by a particularly strong El Nino weather event that warmed the southern Indian Ocean in 1997. The event temporarily pushed the fish and squid on which king penguins depend beyond their foraging range.

"This resulted in population decline and poor breeding success" for all the king penguin colonies in the region, Weimerskirch said.

While the other colonies in the region have bounced back, the one on Pig Island continues to decline, stumping scientists.
